Example: function for scraping lyrics

def scrape_lyrics(artist):
    ...
    return songs

assert len(scrape_lyrics("Ed Sheeran")) > 0
assert len(scrape_lyrics("false")) == 0

Assumption that our program is correct:

We see that all assertions pass:
   Code OK, tests OK
   Code wrong, tests incomplete
   Code wrong, tests wrong

We see that an assertion fails:
   Code wrong, tests OK
   OR
   Code OK, tests wrong
   OR
   Code wrong, tests wrong
   --> proves that there is a problem.

Regression:
1. Write some code
2. Write a test for it (assertions)
3. Run *all* tests
4. Go back to 1

(regression - check whether our code is still working as before)
